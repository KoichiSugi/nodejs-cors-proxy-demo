# nodejs-cors-proxy-demo

This demo is a simple implementation to get a resource on the internet without CORS error.

# Motivation 
Modern browsers block ajax requests and this causes me a trouble not getting resources on the website.
NodeJs will deal with CORS issues as proxy.

#Used technologies and tools:

* Express JS
* JavaScript
* NodeJS

#You need to install the following packages:

## $ npm install node-fetch
light-weight module that brings window.fetch to Node.js
## $ npm install cors
CORS is a node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.
## $ npm install express
Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.
